    <!-- Q1. Difference between div and span?
    Ans-    Div: The div tag is known as Division tag.
                 The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content on the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc).
                 Div tag has both opening(<div>) and closing (</div>) tags and it is mandatory to close the tag.
                 As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. In this example, the div tag contains the entire width. 
                 It will be displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.
        
            Span: In HTML, unlike in block level elements, the inline elements do not start on a new line.
                  It only takes the required width.
                  The span tag is used as a container for some text.
                   This tag can also be used with CSS.
                   Therefore, a part of the text can be styled. The syntax is as follows.
                  <span> Hello World! </span>
                  Both div and span contain the starting tag and ending tag. Both div and span can have style attribute.-->

    <!-- Q2. difference between Class and IDS?
    Ans-   The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML.
           IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it. 
           However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.-->

    <!-- Q3. What are self closing tags?
    Ans-    Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag (<div>), and a closing tag (</div>). However, some HTML elements such as <img> and <input> use only one tag. The tag that belongs to a single-tag element isn’t 
            an opening tag nor a closing tag; it’s a self-closing tag. When you write a self-closing tag in HTML, it is optional to include a forward-slash immediately before the final angle-bracket. 
            Some of self-closing tags are <img>, <input>, <br>, anchor tag <a>.-->

    <!-- Q4. How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where.
    Ans-    In HTML 5 there are six heading tags are there. i.e. <h1> size=32px, <h2> size=24px, <h3> size=18px, <h4> size=16px, <h5> size=13px, <h6> size=10px. These tags are required to close.
            The uses of these heading tags depends on how the content you are going to create on webpage. For one page we should only use only one h1 tag and for sub headings you can go to h2, h3, h4... this is how heading tags are used. -->

    <!-- Q5. Difference between block and inline?
    Ans-    Block elements: In HTML 5, the block elements are the elements that will span the entire width of the parent element, and won’t allow any other element to occupy the same horizontal space as it is placed on. Block elements start with a new line.
            Some block elements are  <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <hr> etc
            Inline elements: In HTML, The inline elements are the elements that cannot be placed directly inside the body element and which are nested within block elements. Inline elements do not start with a new line.
            The inline elements will take only the required width. Some Inline elements are <a>, <b>, <i>, <img> etc-->

    <!-- Q6. Difference between em and strong?
    Ans-    em: The <em> tag is used when you need to emphasize a particular word or phrase within a sentence. 
        The placement of stress emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence.
            When you read em tag text you read it in different tone.
            Syntax:- <em>This is my name</em> 
        
            strong: The <strong> tag can be used to convey importance in a heading, caption, or paragraph when a certain part needs to be distinguished as the part that really matters from other parts
            The <strong> tag can be used to convey urgency, convey seriousness to content that should be seen sooner than other parts of the document.
            The syntax of strong tag is 
            <strong>Strong text...</strong> -->

    <!-- Q7. What are attributes?
    Ans-    HTML tags can contain one or more attributes. 
    Attributes are added to a tag to provide the browser with more information about how the tag should appear or behave. Attributes consist of a name and a value separated by an equals (=) sign.
            Attributes are written inside the opening tag of html tags. Whatever written inside opening of <> this angular brace along side tag is called attribute.
            Example <img src="" alt="">  where src and alt called attributes of img tag-->

    <!-- Q8. Difference between HTML tags and elements?
    Ans-    HTML tags: HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML. They are used to define the HTML elements that should appear on a web page. Without HTML tags, you wouldn't have an HTML page.
            They written inside <> angular bracket. They can be self closing or need to have close tag. Some examples of html tags are below
            <div>, <p>, <head>, <section>, <aside> etc.
            
            HTML Elements: The HTML element is nothing but a content written inside opening and closing tag of html. An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. Any given web page consists of many HTML elements.
            for ex. <h1>My First Website</h1> Here h1 is heading tag and my first website is an html element.-->

    <!-- Q9. Explain br tag?
    Ans-    It is also known as self closing tag.
            The <br> element is classified as a "void element" as it has no content.
            This also means that no end tag is required (or allowed for that matter).
            The <br> tag must be used only for line breaks that are actually part of the content, as in poems or addresses. It should not be used for separating thematic groups in a paragraph. To separate thematic groups, use multiple <p> tags instead.
            The <br> tag is written as <br> at the point where the line break should occur.-->
        
    <!--Q10. What are Semantic tags?
    Ans-   Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.
           For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. 
            This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.
            Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content. For example, instead of using <div id="header"> you can use a <header> tag.
            example: <head>, <footer>, <section>, <main>, <nav> etc.-->
